# My Cherished Project

![Project Showcase](./project-image.png)

This is a project I created when I fully mastered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the second time. 

Today, AI can generate similar projects with ease, but this one was crafted entirely by hand, and it always leaves a lasting impression on me. Even now, I find it to be perfect—though true perfection may not exist. 

When I was about to upload it to my portfolio, I realized that this project is more than just code; it is a creation I will always cherish. Among all my works, this one feels like the perfect piece.
